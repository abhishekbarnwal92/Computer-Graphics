-------------

Implementation includes the following things:

1. Geometric objects such as spheres, triangles and other polygons
2. Local Illumination Model (Ambient, Diffusion, Specular Components)
3. Global Illumination model
4. Recusive Tracing of Rays upto a certain depth (level)
5. Shadow computation
6. Reflection and Refraction
7. Multiple light sources
8. Computaion in World Computation System, but camera/eye/viewer can be specified in Viewing Coordinate System
9. Anti-aliasing using super sampling

Note: Input needs to be specified in a particular format. See input file for example.
Language: C++
